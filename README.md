## üëã Hi there! Welcome to my README!
I'm Udhaya Chandhar Srinivasan, a software engineer, AI enthusiast, and a lifelong learner currently pursuing an MSc in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Cranfield University. My journey blends a solid foundation in performance-critical software engineering with a passion for tackling real-world challenges using cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques.

## üåü About Me
# Professional Background:
I have over 4 years of experience in building performance-critical applications with Java, Javascript and python with some skills in devops. My work has often required diving deep into developing critical features of my application and crafting efficient solutions under challenging constraints.

# Academic Pursuit:
Currently, I‚Äôm deepening my expertise in AI, focusing on topics like regression and classification techniques, Bayesian methods, and Markov decision processes. My coursework includes hands-on projects, like predictive maintenance of aircraft engines, where I‚Äôve explored time-to-failure (TTF) prediction using statistical and machine learning methods. I‚Äôm diving into deep learning for image classification tasks using PyTorch (think CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets), optimization problems in MATLAB, and the mathematics underpinning machine learning (linear algebra, matrices, etc.).

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills and Technologies
# Core Expertise:

- Proficient in Java with Springboot, Hibernate, JPA, Multi-Threading.
- Proficient in Javascript with React, Angular, Redux, etc.
- Strong background in RDBMS systems like Oracle, PostgreSQL and MySQL.
